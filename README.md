# Recommendation-System
- Recommendation Systems employs a data-driven methodology to offer customers tailored recommendations. It uses user data and algorithms to forecast and suggest goods, services, or content that a user is probably going to find interesting. These systems are essential in applications where users may become overwhelmed by large volumes of information, such as social media, streaming services, and e-commerce.
  
Recommender System is of different types:

- Content-Based Recommendation: It is supervised machine learning used to induce a classifier to discriminate between interesting and uninteresting items for the user.
- Collaborative Filtering: Collaborative Filtering recommends items based on similarity measures between users and/or items. The basic assumption behind the algorithm is that users with similar interests have common preferences.
